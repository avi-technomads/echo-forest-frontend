            Echo Forest began when co-Founders Brooks Clifford and Matt Benesch
            realized they had a combination of shared passions that they wanted

            The main driver of Echo Forest is the Echo App; an online play2earn
            gaming platform that rewards gamers for their engagement. Users are
            able to sign-up on the platform for free, and earn crypto for
            playing video games. Users can also earn additional rewards by
            writing online reviews and answering survey questionnaires. The Echo
            App is currently in development and is expected to launch in 2023.

            Weâ€™ve created 10,000 unique NFTs, each representing a character in
            the fantasy world called the Echoverse. Every NFT in our collection
            is a combination of 1 of 10 different forest animals, plus an
            assigned class or profession and is equipped with anywhere from 2-4
            items that vary in rarity from common to unique.
